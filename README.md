# Sathvika Kolisetty - Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my personal data engineering portfolio. I am a Cloud Data Engineer with over 4 years of experience in building scalable, cloud-native data platforms and real-time streaming pipelines. This portfolio showcases key projects that reflect my experience across cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), big data tools, orchestration, and generative AI systems.

## Projects

### Cross-Cloud GenAI Recommendation Engine
**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, AWS Kinesis, AWS Glue, Lambda, GCP Vertex AI, S3, FastAPI, Streamlit

Built a real-time recommendation engine powered by generative AI. Ingested user behavior data using Kinesis and Glue, stored and modeled data in Snowflake, and deployed Vertex AI for model inference. A Streamlit-based frontend enabled live interaction with recommendations.

- Improved recommendation accuracy by 30 percent using fine-tuned embedding models
- Reduced Snowflake compute costs by 25 percent using materialized views and partitioned storage
